# cr-200b-klipper-config
Use everything described here at your own risk

Settings for printer.cfg based on https://github.com/ChewyJetpack/CR-200B-Klipper-Config/blob/main/printer.cfg and modified for my needs

Can print at speed 150mm/s (for infill) and 3k accel on default hardware (except hotend, i use Dragonfly BMS). Not so great quality, but pretty fast. Nice quality at speed <=80mm/s and accel <1k

This printer has "exotic" board v4.2.5 without public documentation. But you can rely on board for CR-30 (v4.2.10) as said here https://klipper.discourse.group/t/creality-cr-200b-2021/1090, at least on it's pinout.
